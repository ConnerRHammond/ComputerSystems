1. Socket(), Connect()
2.You would need to call sendto and recvfrom instead of recv and send
3.sendto
4.It using the same port each time
5.It uses a different port for each socket but the same port for each socket.
6. One socket for all clients
7. Three times
8. Just the 1 
9. 3 
10. UDP only takes one packet at a time
11. After listen is has a socket willing to connect and accept accepts an actual connection.
12. Connect with UDP sets to where you'll send and receive data grams where in TCP it set up a connection to another socket.
13. It needs to establish a connection before it sends any information back and forth.
14. For the same socket messages are from the same port value
15. The port value changes when using a different socekt.
16. It is using one for each client
17.Client is writing 3 times
18. It received 1 message
19. It called recv only 2 times.
20.Since TCP is set up as a stream it can receive multiple messages at a time unlike UDP which has to receive one data packet at a time

1. Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side;
With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain.
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In ev'ry change he faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heav'nly Friend
Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

2. Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as he has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below.

3. Be still, my soul: The hour is hast'ning on
When we shall be forever with the Lord,
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

26.the receive call waits for a
    message to arrive, unless the socket is nonblocking (see fcntl(2)) in
     which case the value -1 is returned and the external variable errno set
     to EAGAIN.
27.It returns what you have and doesnt block.
28.It throws excess bytes.
